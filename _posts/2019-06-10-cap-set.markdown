[Sander Dahmen](http://www.few.vu.nl/~sdn249/), [Johannes Hölzl](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~jhl890/), and
I have formalized [Ellenberg and Gijswijt's solution to the cap set
problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09223) in Lean. [Our paper about this
project](https://lean-forward.github.io/e-g/) will appear at ITP 2019. [Here are some
slides]({{site.url}}/files/capset_long_slides.pdf) from a talk I gave about this formalization.

The cap set problem is a combinatorial question, easy to ask but difficult to answer. Briefly, it
asks about the growth rate of the cardinality of *cap sets*, subsets of a group that contain no
three-term arithmetic progression, as the dimension of the underlying space increases. Ellenberg and
Gijswijt discovered a solution in 2016; their celebrated proof appeared in the *Annals of
Mathematics* in 2017. The approach that Ellenberg and Gijswijt take is an extremely clever
application of elementary methods, which makes it a good candidate to formalize.

Very little cutting-edge mathematics is formalized in proof assistants. Reasons for this are
well-documented throughout the literature: the costs are too high; the tools and infrastructure are
not ready; the general expertise isn't there. The [Lean Forward
project](https://lean-forward.github.io) aims to change this, by spurring collaboration between tool
developers, formalizers, and mathematicians. Our project is a step toward these goals. Admittedly,
our choice of a formalization target is uniquely accessible. But this gives us a first data point
for Lean Forward: at least one modern, noteworthy paper in mathematics can be formalized with a
reasonable amount of time and effort.

Lean Forward emphasizes that collaboration between people from different areas is needed to bring
formalized mathematics to the mainstream. Our project is an example of exactly this kind of
collaboration. We need mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and people in between to come
together to make
