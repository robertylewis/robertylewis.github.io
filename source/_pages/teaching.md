### Logic and Proof

I am helping develop an open-source course and text on mathematical proof and argument. The course
uses examples from the [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io) proof assistant. We have designed the
course to encourage students to think about mathematics from three perspectives: the formal (logic
and natural deduction), the informal (natural-language concepts and proofs), and the semi-formal
(exemplified by Lean).

The most recent version of the text can be found [here](https://avigad.github.io/logic_and_proof/)
(interactive) or [here](https://avigad.github.io/logic_and_proof/logic_and_proof.pdf) (pdf), and the
development is tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/avigad/logic_and_proof).

In Fall 2016, Jeremy Avigad and I co-taught a sophomore-level course at CMU using these notes. In
Spring 2019, I will teach a second year CS course at VU Amsterdam using these notes.
